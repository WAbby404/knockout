Knockout.js
- Open source JS library
- MIT license
- Compact
- Works on most browsers
- uses Model-View-View Model (MVVM) pattern

MVVM
- Model: The data displayed in the User Interface
- View: HTML or "What the user sees"
- View Model: Code that glues it all together (event handling, binding, business logic, etc...)

4 Things that Knockout gives you:
ko.observable - like a piece of state 
              - Knockout under the hood will track changes
              - If an observable changes, Knockout knows to change the DOM
              - Early precursor to React paradigm, matching props and state

ko.applyBindings - How Knockout is initalized on the page
                 - Typically only called once unless components are entering and leaving the page

data-bind - An attribute located somewhere in the DOM
          - How we get info from the DOM into our JavaScript & vice versa
          - Surround the stateful part with a span tag to add the data-bind attribute to

ko.computed - takes a function that utilizes other observales to make a result
            - returns a result based off of another observable


How to update observables -> call variable as a fn. (like line 5 in ex2 index.js)
